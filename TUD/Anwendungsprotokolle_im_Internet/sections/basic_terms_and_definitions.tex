\section{Basic Terms and Definitions}

In this chapter, basic terms will defined and explained.

\begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{\acs{TCP}/\acs{IP} Conceptional Layers:}
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{Application:} Standardizes communication interfaces built on Transport Layer protocols for specific classes of applications.\\
                        \textbf{Protocols:} \ac{HTTP}, \ac{SSH}, \ac{DNS}, \ac{DHCP}, \ac{NTP}, \ac{POP3}, \ac{IMAP}, \ac{SMTP}, \ac{SSL}/\ac{TLS} (...)
                  \item \textit{Transport:} Provide process-to-process communication for application using ports. Features which might be given depending on the protocol are connection-oriented communication, reliability, error correction, flow-control and multiplexing (e.g. multicast / broadcast).\\
                        \textbf{Protocols:} \ac{TCP}, \ac{UDP} (...)
                  \item \textit{Internet:} Routing and transmission from source to destination.\\
                        \textbf{Protocols:} \ac{IP} (v4, v6) (...)
                  \item \textit{Network Interface:} Transmission of data between two computers in the same network via physical connection.\\
                        \textbf{Protocols:} \ac{MAC}, Tunnels, \ac{PPP} (...)
            \end{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Datagram:} A datagram is a basic transfer unit in a packet-switched network. Datagrams consist of a header and payload. They contain address information and can be send in connectionsless communication.
      \item \textbf{\acf{UDP}:} \ac{UDP} provides a simple connectionless communication model. It provides checksums for verification of data integrity and port numbers for addressing specific services on the target machine. It does not have handshaking dialogues and requires no previous packets to be send prior to communication. Messages are mapped directly to packets and are not split up into peaces. \ac{UDP} does not provide a guarantee of delivery, order of packets, or duplicate protection. It therefore exposes the application layer to any unreliability of the network for the sake of less communication overhead. It is suitable for applications which do not require reliability but do require speed e.g. in video streaming or for applications which handle resubmission, ordering and duplicate checking themselves.
      \item \textbf{\acf{TCP}:} \ac{TCP} follows a connection-oriented communication model providing reliability, ordering and error checking and flow-control (not allowing one side to send too fast). Messages are handled as a stream of bytes which is split into packets of undefined size for transmission.
            \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{Connection establishment and termination:} The connection is established using a three-way handshake consisting of the packets SYN $\rightarrow$, SYN-ACK $\leftarrow$ and ACK $\rightarrow$. The connection termination is done with a four-way handshake consisting of the packets FIN $\rightarrow$, ACK $\leftarrow$, FIN $\leftarrow$ and ACK $\rightarrow$. It is possible to shorten this by sending a FIN-ACK as a reply to the FIN
                  \item \textit{Reliability:} \ac{TCP} uses sequence numbers to identify each byte of data, as shown in figure \ref{fig:tcp_data_transmission}. The sequence number of the first byte is randomly chosen by the sender of the first packet in order to defend against TCP sequence prediction attacks. Each \ac{TCP}-packet contains a sequence number and \textendash{} if it is an ACK packet \textendash{} an acknowledgement number. The sequence number of the packet is the sequence number of the first byte send in this message or the sequence number of the last byte send in previous messages in case the payload (data) of the packet has size zero (as for ACK packets). The acknowledgement number is the incremented sequence number of the last byte received. TCP uses cumulative ACKs, which means that an acknowledgement number of $n$ acknowledges all bytes with sequence number $< n$.
                  \item \textit{Resubmission:} If a single segment in a stream is lost, then the receiver cannot acknowledge subsequent packets, because of the cumulative acknowledgement semantics. TCP uses two mechanisms to trigger the resubmission of lost packets. The first one is \textit{resubmission on duplicate ACKs}, which means the receiver will send ACKs for every subsequently received packet containing the last sequence number before missing packet. If the sender receives three ACKs for the same packet, it will trigger the resubmission of the missing packet. The other mechanism for resubmission is \textit{timeout-based resubmission}, which means that packets will be resubmitted if they are not acknowledged within a given time frame. After a timeout has been triggered, the timeout for the resubmitted packet will be doubled.
                  \item \textit{Flow Control:} \ac{TCP} uses a sliding window flow control protocol. The receiver specifies in the \textit{receive window} field of the packet how many bytes it is able to (or willing to) buffer for this connection. The sender can only send that amount of bytes without receiving an ACK, because the ACK signalizes that bytes up to the given acknowledgement number are out of the buffer. This prevents slower machines being overwhelmed with packets, which is important in the internet, because end devices can be very different.
                  \item \textit{Error Detection:} In order to detect submission errors, a checksum field ist concluded. However, most errors are also corrected by protocols of underlying layers such as in the Ethernet frame.
            \end{enumerate}

            .
      \item \textbf{\ac{AS}:} The internet is a network of computer networks instead of just a huge network of computers. The big networks, which the internet consists of and which are handled independently of their internal structure are called \acp{AS}. This principle allows for scalability, because responsibilities are distributed. In todays world, \acp{AS} are administrative domains hosted by big companies, which commercially offer access to all computers that can be accessed inside or through this system to other \acp{AS}. The routing between \acp{AS} is organized using a so called \ac{EGP}, while routing inside of \acp{AS} is managed using so called \ac{EGP}s. The \ac{EGP} used in todays internet is the \ac{BGP}. For \ac{EGP} the host of the \ac{AS} can choose from multiple protocols such as e.g. \ac{OSPF} or \ac{EIGRP} depending on the internal network topology. Only the edge gateways of an \ac{AS} are responsible for the routing between \acp{AS}, such that internal routers only need to handle internal routing information.
      \item \textbf{\acf{BGP}:} The \ac{BGP} is todays \acs{EGP} connecting \acp{AS}. If a new IP address is registered inside of an \ac{AS}, this will be reported to the edge router of the \ac{AS} via an \ac{IGP}. This edge router then transmits the information about the accessibility of this IP address via this \ac{AS} to the edge routers of all other \acp{AS} it is connected to. These edge routers then share this information to all other edge routers of their \ac{AS}, which further share it to other routers of other connected \acp{AS}. As a result, each edge router of an \ac{AS} will know what IP addresses are available inside or behind its own network. They however will no know the exact path, unless the target IP address is located inside of the own \ac{AS}. When a computer inside of one \ac{AS} wants to send a packet to a computer in another \ac{AS}, an \ac{IGP} will lead the packet to the edge router of the \ac{AS}, which will then send it to another suitable \ac{AS}. The receiving edge router then internally routes it to the computer, if it is located in that \ac{AS}, or to another edge router which is connected to other \acp{AS}, which are closer to the destination IP address. This way, routers in an \ac{AS} do not need to know the internal structure of other \acp{AS}, which makes this approach scalable.
      \item \textbf{\acf{RTT}:} Is the transmission time for a packet from point A to point B plus the transmission time of the ACK-packet from point B back to point A. It can be determined using the ping command.
      \item \textbf{\acf{NAT}:} TODO:
      \item \textbf{Subnetting:} TODO:
