\section{Glossary}

In this chapter, basic terms will be defined and explained.

\subsection{Massively Parallel Programming}

\acf{MPP} is a programming model which makes enormous use of multithreading and therefore of multi-core parallelization. As opposed to in distributed systems, in \ac{MPP} all processes or threads share common main memory, such that messages/information travel almost instantaneously from one execution thread to another. Also, communication is much less error-prone, because it is done in main memory as opposed to via a network.

\subsection{Computer Network}

A \ac{CN} is a set of \acp{AS} connected by a \ac{CSS}. Here an \ac{AS} is not an \ac{AS} in the sense of autonomous computer networks, but instead a single node of a computer network i.e. some CPU with some memory.
