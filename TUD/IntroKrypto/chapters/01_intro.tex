\chapter{Introduction}

Cryptography is the science of the methods for securing information, data and systems.

Typically we talk about certain key concepts, which differ from book to book. In this course, we define them as the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{C}] Confidentiality: Attackers cannot read a message.
    \item[\textbf{I}] Integrity: Attackers cannot modify the content of a message (in a narrow sense), cannot fake the message's sender address (authenticity) and receivers cannot claim, they have received the message (non-repudiation).
    \item[\textbf{A}] Availability: A system is always functional (less relevant in this course)
\end{enumerate}
